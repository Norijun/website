Evacuated families in Northern Cebu can now go home after storm signal lifted, says PDRRMO
ABOUT 1,488 families or 7,376 individuals from 10 local government units in Northern Cebu that had to evacuate due to Typhoon Tisoy can now return to their homes today, Dec. 3, 2019, after the state weather bureau lifted the typhoon warning signal there earlier today.
Rhee Telen Jr. of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) said officials of Bogo City and the towns of Madridejos, Bantayan, Daanbantayan, San Remigio, Carmen, Medellin, Santa Fe, Sogod, Tabogon, San Francisco, Aloguinsan and Borbon conducted a preemptive evacuation on Monday afternoon, Dec. 2, after Northern Cebu was placed under Signal No. 2.
Meanwhile, aside from a mango tree that had toppled and blocked the national highway in Asturias town, there were no reports of damage to property and casualties brought about by Tisoy, Telen added.
Tisoy slightly weakened after it made its second landfall over Marinduque Tuesday, December 3.
In its 11 a.m. update, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said Tisoy made its second landfall at 8:30 a.m. and is now heading toward Batangas-northern Oriental Mindoro area.
It first made landfall in Gubat, Sorsogon around 11 p.m. Monday, December 2.
Tropical Cyclone Wind Signals (TCWS) over Ifugao, Mountain Province, northern Cebu, Bohol, northern Negros Oriental, Eastern Samar and the rest of Samar were lifted.
